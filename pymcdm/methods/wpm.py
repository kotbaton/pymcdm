class WPM(MCDA_method):
    """ Weighted Product Model (WPM) [1].

        WPM is based on an approach that evaluates alternatives by weighted product.

        Parameters
        ----------
           normalization_function : callable
               Function which should be used to normalize `matrix` columns. It should match signature `foo(x, cost)`,
               where `x` is a vector which should be normalized and `cost` is a bool variable which says if `x` is a
               cost or profit criterion.
